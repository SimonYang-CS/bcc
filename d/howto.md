```
1. kparc day starts with a pull followed by a hello
2. we commit often but we are reasonable
3. commit msgs are lowercase and usually begin with a verb in imperative mood
4. `blah` is not a verb except `[~]` meaning `zap that typo`
5. consider `git config pull.rebase true`
6. tabs and `\r\n` are evil, dangling space is not cool, indent is `0x20`
7. enjoy responsibly when you push to master
8. once there are tests, consider a pre-commit hook
9. code comments are essential, kparc uses doxygen
10. kparc code is 99% reflection 1% keyboard

reflogs are like so:

[-] remove excess code
[+] add quality code
[~] fix an imperfection
[!] request a peer review
[=] land something cool
[===] land something epic
```
